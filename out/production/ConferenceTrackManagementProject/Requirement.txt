Proposals (Many):
	Subject (arg [0]) - No number in it

	IsScreeningPass:
        Duration (in Minutes) (arg [0])
        title (String) (arg [1])

PROPOSAL MANAGEMENT
Actions:
       1. proposal store it in right data structure  (Collections, hash table / Map / Set):  should not take
        duplicates, no ordering required
       2. sorting algorithm - required

Screening Process (Manual):

Time Constraint:

***
TRACK MANAGEMENT
Conference:
  Tracks (Multiple)
	  Sessions
		Morning Session (9AM to 12 PM) = 180 min
		Evening Session (1 PM and 4PM) = 180 mins
		Networking Session (4 PM to 5 PM)

Problem Statement:
It is multiple combinations:
You need to find 2 sets of session with 180 min total, each session
if you have multiple tracks, don't consider the topics the you considered in the other track
Any Known Algorithm?? -  First Fit, Bin Packaging Problem (Bin Size = 180), for n bin output, apply nP2 permutation

Possible Data Modelling for Output
